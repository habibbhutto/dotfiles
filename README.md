Development setup and configuration files

## TODO
* neovim configuration
    * WIP: configurations for go, i.e. go.vim
    * WIP: fix cmp showing double entries sometimes
    * WIP: optionally if some tabline makes sense
    * snips to accelerate development
    * test run logs, do I really need it?

## Not TODO at this point
* neovim configuration
    * fine tune lsp config
      - move lsp config to language specifc plugins
    * fine tune ctags
      - ctags should auto run
      - this should be project based
    * improve project based config
      - load project specifc config
    * fine tune treesitter based tools
      - things are slow at this point, so wait

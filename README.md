    * configurations for go, i.e. go.vim
    * fix cmp showing double entries when listing files
    * theme changing mechanism
      - make it super easy to change themes across the tools
        alacritty, tmux, neovim, bat, wezterm, etc
      - configure light and black themes
      - switch them based on system theme or at will
      - reactive to system style
    * snips to accelerate development
    * test run logs, do I really need it?

## Not TODO at this point
* neovim configuration
    * fine tune lsp config
      - move lsp config to language specifc plugins
    * fine tune ctags
      - ctags should auto run
      - this should be project based
    * improve project based config
      - load project specifc config
    * fine tune treesitter based tools
      - things are slow at this point, so wait
